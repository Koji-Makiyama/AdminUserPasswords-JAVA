This Java app is a work-in-progress that simulates the creation of passwords for an admin or user object. Using the Scanner utility, the user interacts with the program.
You are guided through a series of questions that lead you to the creation of an object (Admin/User account) where you then set your username and your password.
This information is saved by means of adding it to an ArrayList (Java.util package) located in the Main class.
